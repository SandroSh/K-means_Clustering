# Project Overview
In this project, there is developed k-means and K-medoids clustering algorithm from the ground up. Clustering is an unsupervised machine 
learning method used to discover patterns within data.

Clustering is applied to the FIFA players dataset to group players based on factors such as age, salary, potential, market value, and overall rating.
Through k-means clustering, we can visually distinguish players who are in their prime, those who are young with immense future potential, 
and those approaching the later stages of their careers. This method uncovers hidden patterns and offers valuable insights into player progression, 
development, and market value.
# Data
We'll be using data from FIFA, file players_22.csv.
